Hi, I'm Takashi Matsusakiâ€”a lifelong builder and leader. I've been developing software since childhood.

I'm passionate about all things software and am currently exploring ideas in the AI and blockchain spaces, aiming to make a meaningful impact.

I love working on open-source projects and enjoy contributing to others' work, such as https://github.com/foundry-rs/compilers/pull/35.

## Experience (Reverse chronological order)

- Currently bootstrapping several MVPs while considering starting a startup.
- Founded [an open-source, decentralized online game](https://game.open-emoji-battler.community/) built on blockchain, where I managed the entire project and handled all aspects of development and operations.
- Architected the backend and formed/led the team at one of Japan's leading smartphone game companies. Successfully handled write-heavy traffic (~10,000 requests/sec) using techniques like load balancing and database sharding.
- Studied Electronics and Information Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Ishikawa College. (*Note: This competitive Japanese college admits students after junior high school, and I earned my high school diploma there.*)
- Began my professional career at age 17, working as a part-time software engineer during a school break.
- Won Japan's premier youth programming contest with a web application I developed. (*33rd U-20 Programming Contest, hosted by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry*)
- As a kid, I built web apps, smartphone apps, video games, and even custom Minecraft servers.
