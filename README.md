Hi, I'm Tash Matsusakiâ€”a lifelong builder. I've been passionately developing software for fun since childhood, nearly 20 years.

I'm enthusiastic about all things software and am currently exploring exciting project ideas with high-impact potential.

I love working on and contributing to open-source projects, such as https://github.com/foundry-rs/compilers/pull/35.

## Experience (Reverse chronological order)

- Currently bootstrapping several MVPs and exploring potential startup opportunities.
- Founded [an open-source, decentralized online game](https://game.open-emoji-battler.community/) built on blockchain technology.
- Led and architected the backend at one of Japan's leading smartphone game companies, managing write-heavy traffic (~10,000 requests/sec) through load balancing and database sharding.
- Began my professional career at age 17 as a part-time software engineer during school breaks, transitioning to full-time at 18.
- Won a prestigious youth programming contest organized by a Japanese government agency during college (*33rd U-20 Programming Contest, hosted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry*).
- Built web apps, smartphone apps, video games, and custom Minecraft servers during my childhood years.
